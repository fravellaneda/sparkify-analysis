# Predict Churn Sparkify Users

Sparkify is a fake streaming music service created by Udacity for education purposes. This streaming service can be used for free (without ads between songs) or you can subscribe for no ads. However, if you subscribe to a paid service you can downgrade or upgrade anytime. The main goal of this work is to predict if a user will stop using Sparkify it doesn't matter if he is a free or paid user.

## Motivation

When you offer a product or a service you want to keep your customers engaged with your brand. This happened because is more expensive to get new customers than retain older ones. For this reason, it's very important to understand why a customer would stop consuming the service or the product. To understand this behavior, there is a key concept called Churn User.

A Churn user is a person that at some point has decided to stop buying or consuming a service. This definition could be changed depending on the core business. However, most of the time, after a month that a user doesn't interact with the brand, will be called a Churn user.Â 

As you may notice it's very important to know what are the main reasons why a customer would be a Churn user or try to predict a Churn user before that happened. This information becomes relevant because if you knew about Churn users you would give them a discount or gifts to avoid these users leaving.
